"""Contextual ASR prompt variant stage (CPU-only).

Reads the entity extraction dict produced by
:class:`ContextualASRExtractionStage` and appends six prompt-variant
fields to it.  Each variant provides a different level of context
information for training a context-biased ASR model.

The stage is language-aware: when a per-sample source language is
available under ``source_lang_key`` (default ``source_lang``), about half
of the templates sampled per sample explicitly mention the language
(e.g. ``"Transcribe the French audio …"``).  Templates that don't
reference the language remain in the pool too, so the rendered prompts
still vary in phrasing.  When the source-lang field is missing or
empty, the stage falls back to the language-agnostic templates only,
preserving back-compat with older manifests.

This stage is deterministic — it uses a per-sample seeded RNG derived
from ``sha256(seed + audio_filepath)`` so results are reproducible
regardless of batch order, worker count, or shard layout.  The domain
pool used for negative sampling is fixed at init and never mutated.
No GPU or LLM is required.

class ContextualASRPromptVariantStage(ProcessingStage[AudioTask, AudioTask]):
    """Generate six prompt variants from extracted context-ASR entities.

    Reads the extraction dict written by
    :class:`ContextualASRExtractionStage` (under ``context_key``) and
    appends six prompt-variant fields to the same dict.

    This is a CPU-only stage — no LLM or GPU required.

    The six variants provide different levels of context information
    for training a context-biased ASR model:

    - ``contextless_prompt``: plain transcription instruction
    - ``coarse_context_prompt``: domain label only
    - ``fine_context_prompt``: domain + entity list
    - ``distractor_prompt``: domain + entities shuffled with distractors
    - ``partial_context_prompt``: domain + random 50-80% of entities
    - ``negative_context_prompt``: wrong-domain label

    Args:
        context_key: Manifest key holding the extraction dict.
        sample_id_key: Manifest key used to derive the per-sample RNG
            seed.  Must be a stable identifier (e.g. ``audio_filepath``)
            so that outputs are deterministic regardless of batch order,
            worker count, or shard layout.
        source_lang_key: Manifest key holding the per-sample source
            language (display name or code).  When present and non-empty
            the stage mixes language-aware templates into the sampling
            pool.  When missing or empty, the stage falls back to the
            language-agnostic templates only.
        seed: Base RNG seed combined with the sample id hash.
        partial_keep_lo: Lower bound of the random keep fraction for the
            partial-context variant (default 0.5).
        partial_keep_hi: Upper bound of the random keep fraction for the
            partial-context variant (default 0.8).  Each sample draws a
            uniform fraction in ``[partial_keep_lo, partial_keep_hi]``.
        min_entities_for_partial: Minimum entity count to produce a
            distinct partial variant (below this, falls back to fine).
        domain_pool: Optional list of domain labels for negative
            sampling.  Uses a built-in default pool if not provided.
            The pool is never mutated at runtime.
